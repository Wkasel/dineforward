Within three days of your donation, the restaurant will receive the funds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Does my entire donation go to the restaurant?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we do not charge for this service. The only fee that is applied is the Stripe processing fee of 2.9% plus $0.30. You can choose to cover this for the restaurant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>My favorite restaurant isn&rsquo;t on DineForward, how can I support them?</strong></p>\n<p>You can get them added! Click here to recommend a business &amp; send them a link to join.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When will I be able to redeem my gift?</strong></p>\n<p>For in-house experiences: If the business is still open or offering takeout, you can redeem right away if applicable. Otherwise, you will be able to redeem once the establishment opens. Unfortunately, there is no exact date for when the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions will be over and we&rsquo;re all taking it day by day. We recommend checking the news and individual business pages and social media for updates on re-opening.</p>\n<p>For virtual experiences: the business will work with you on a date / time to redeem. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How long do I have to redeem my gift?</strong></p>\n<p>Your gift is redeemable for one year from the purchase date. Honoring gifts after expiration is at the discretion of the business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve changed my mind, can I get my money back?</strong></p>\n<p>All donations are final. The restaurants use the funds to help keep them afloat in these turbulent times and cannot refund any donations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What cities is this available in?</strong></p>\n<p>DineForward can be used by businesses in any city in the US. Don&rsquo;t see yours? Click here for a link to share with your favorite local establishments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What if the establishment I donated to still goes out of business?</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, this could happen despite all our efforts.

From there you will build your profile &amp; setup payment information. Before your account goes live, you must go through our quick &amp; easy verification process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a fee to participate?</strong><br />No, there is no fee to participate. DineForward makes no money on this service. The only fee that is charged are the credit card processing fees through Stripe of 2.9% plus $0.30. When donating, customers will have the option to cover this fee for you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of thank you gifts can I offer my supporters?</strong><br />There are three types of gifts you can offer. &nbsp;You can choose to do any combination of these. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>(1) You can give a credit for when the business reopens. This can be anything you want, but here are a few examples: Credit for a future round of cocktails, $100 dining credit for $75, a future three-course meal. We&rsquo;re happy to help you decide the right options for your business. Note: if you are currently open &amp; operating a takeout model, customers can use the credit now.</p>\n<p>(2) You can give a credit for a group experience when the business reopens. This allows several customers to buy an experience together. Example: a happy hour for 6 that includes two rounds of drinks and two appetizers.</p>\n<p>(3) You can give a virtual experience to be used now. These can be live interactions with your customers. Examples: a virtual cooking lesson, cocktail making class, or wine tasting lesson.</p>\n<p>You are not required to offer gifts to be featured on DineForward, you can choose to accept donations without a gift. &nbsp;We recommend gifts to increase donations and to thank your supporters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How do I get paid?</strong><br />We use Stripe Connect to facilitate payments. If you already have a Stripe account, we can get you setup right away. If you don&rsquo;t have one, it&rsquo;s easy to setup and verification is usually instant. It takes 7 days for your first payment on a new stripe account to be processed, but after that it will take two business days.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Can I use a different payment provider other than Stripe?</strong><br />We require businesses to use Stripe Connect because it allows us to send your donations without ever needing your account info. We want you to protect that sensitive info.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What if I already sell gift cards or have a donation page elsewhere?</strong><br />Fantastic! We&rsquo;ll provide a link to your gift card or donation site on your business page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What if my patrons want to donate without getting anything in return?</strong><br />They have the option to donate any amount without getting a gift in return. When they purchase a donation tier with a gift, they will have the option to send an additional donation with no gift.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What can I use the funds for?</strong><br />Anything you need to keep your business running: rent, salaries, supplies etc. &nbsp;We recommend letting customers know how you will use the funds through your business profile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What happens if we have to close our business permanently?</strong><br />Sadly, we understand this could happen. We have provided our users with this knowledge, but recommend ample communication via your website and social media so people can stay updated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How can I close my DineForward account?</strong><br />You can end your participation in DineForward at any time. All you need to do is email us at team@dineforward.org and we&rsquo;ll make sure you are fully paid out, send a record of all transactions, and close your page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

You acknowledge and agree that the use of third party payment processors are integral to the Services and that we may exchange information with such third parties in order to facilitate the provision of Services as set out in our Privacy Policy.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Member Account, Password and Security:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account.

Additionally, user profile information, including your first and last name, public email address, organization, personal biography, and other information you enter in connection with your user profile may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. For example, as a Business Organizer, you might post your personal data - such as information about a recent hospital stay - which data might be considered sensitive data. In addition, as a Donor, you have the option to publicly display your Donation for all to see, including on search engines (like Google and Yahoo). To keep the details of your Donation private from the general public, simply click the \"Private\" checkbox during the Donation process. Please remember that if you choose to provide information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available.

DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The Process.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms of Service. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at</span><a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.adr.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (&ldquo;</span><strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;). Our current address for Notice is: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WM Kasel Holdings LLC, ℅ Legal Department,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2201 Broadway, Oakland, CA, 94612</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;</span><strong>Demand</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;). We agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren&rsquo;t successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.00.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Fees.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>No Class Actions.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Enforceability.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If this Disputes section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the General section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body. However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>TERMINATION</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You agree that DineForward, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom.</span></p>\n<p><strong>USER DISPUTES</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Services and DineForward will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. DineForward reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Services.</span></p>\n<p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and DineForward and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and DineForward with respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and DineForward agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California. The failure of DineForward to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of DineForward, but DineForward may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not result in a waiver of that right. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Services may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platforms. DineForward may, at any time, assign our rights or delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of equity or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in these Terms shall prevent DineForward from complying with the law. DineForward shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</span></p>\n<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At DineForward, we respect the privacy of our users.

Some of the Analytical cookies used are set by us, and some are set by third parties such as Google Analytics, to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. You can learn about Google&rsquo;s practices by going to </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/\"><strong>https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</strong></a><strong>.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>We also work with third-party advertising companies to show you ads we think may be of interest to you and to track sales from ads for our Services.

As we adopt additional technologies, we may gather additional information through other methods. We will notify you of such changes as described in the &ldquo;Changes to DineForward's Privacy Policy&rdquo; section below.)&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your cookie preferences</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers or mobile devices.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>You can also consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., </strong><a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies\"><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647\"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies#Firefox\"><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></a><strong>; or </strong><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042\"><strong>Apple Safari</strong></a><strong>).

You can also limit information collection by uninstalling the App on your device and you can use the standard uninstall process available as part of your device for this purpose.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Other technology</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Web beacons: A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable the Platform to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. We may use them in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Platform. We may also use web beacons to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URLs (links within the email) were clicked.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pixel Tags: In addition, we may use pixel tags (also referred to as clear gifs or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of our users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user&rsquo;s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags also allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to information that is intended to identify our users.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Information From Social Networking Services</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>One of the special features of the Services is that it allows you to enable or log into the Services via various social networking services like Facebook or Twitter (\"Social Networking Service(s)\").
